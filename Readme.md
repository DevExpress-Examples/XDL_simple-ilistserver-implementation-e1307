# Simple IListServer implementation


<p>This simple IListServer interface implementation was made to illustrate interface members: what data should be passed in arguments and what result these members are expected to produce.</p>
<p>This is a basic implementation that doesn't demonstrate the efficiency of server mode data sources. To make all the grid functionality work, it is necessary to implement the remaining methods of this interface and modify methods implemented in this sample to use features of the actual underlying data source. For an example of a complete implementation of this interface, refer to the source code of the built-in server mode components:<br><em>c:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 16.1\Components\Sources\DevExpress.Data\DataController\ServerMode\</em><br><em>c:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 16.1\Components\Sources\DevExpress.Xpo\DevExpress.Xpo\ServerModeGridSource.cs</em><br><em>c:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 16.1\Components\Sources\DevExpress.Xpf.Core\DevExpress.Xpf.Core\Editors\Controls\LookUp\DataLayer\DataController\ServerMode\</em><br><br></p>
